                        <h2>Demonstration</h2>
                        <p>The application allows users to input questions in natural language, such as "How many students are in section Q?" The tool converts the question into an SQL query, executes it on the SQLite database, and displays the results.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Input:</strong> "How many entries of records are present?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Generated SQL Query:</strong> <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM STUDENT;</code></li>
                            <li><strong>Output:</strong> `10`</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                        <h3>Challenges</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Handling Incorrect or Ambiguous Inputs:</strong> Ensuring the generated SQL queries are syntactically correct and handling cases where the input question is ambiguous or lacks sufficient detail.</li>
                            <li><strong>Secure and Efficient Query Execution:</strong> Ensuring the application is secure and prevents SQL injection attacks while optimizing query execution to handle large datasets efficiently.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <h3>Solutions</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Validation and Error Handling:</strong> Implementing validation checks for the generated SQL queries and providing user feedback and suggestions for improving input questions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> Using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and implementing input sanitization and validation to ensure only valid queries are executed.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>This project successfully developed a tool that converts natural language questions into SQL queries using Google Gemini and Streamlit. The tool simplifies data retrieval from databases, making it accessible to non-technical users.</p>
                
                        <h3>Future Work</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Support for More Databases:</strong> Extend support to other databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.</li>
                            <li><strong>Improved NLP Model:</strong> Enhance the natural language processing model to handle more complex queries and diverse question formats.</li>
                            <li><strong>User Interface Enhancements:</strong> Improve the user interface to provide a more interactive and intuitive experience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Additional Functionality:</strong> Enable users to create new databases and tables, allow users to insert data into existing tables, and implement functionality for updating and deleting records.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Non-Technical Users:</strong> Users who need to interact with databases but lack SQL knowledge, including business analysts and managers who require data retrieval for decision-making.</li>
                            <li><strong>Educational Institutions:</strong> Students and educators can use the tool for learning and teaching SQL.</li>
                            <li><strong>Small Businesses:</strong> Small business owners who need to manage their data without hiring a dedicated database administrator.</li>
                            <li><strong>Developers:</strong> Developers who want to quickly prototype and test database queries without writing SQL.</li>
                        </ul>
